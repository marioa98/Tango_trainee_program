# Tango Trainee Program

## Content of the repository

In each branch of this repository I store all the resorces of the Tango Trainee Program 2020 like

- Books (About Software tools, programming languages and softskills).
- Koans (Coding kata to learn Ruby).
- Exercises.
- Ruby on Rails projects.
- Notes.
- And more.

## Goal

Improve my git habilities at the same time that I learn another cool stuff in the program (like Vim, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Design Patterns, etc).
